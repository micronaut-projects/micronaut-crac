We currently support https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-sql/latest/guide[Hikari DataSources] that are configured to allow suspension with:

[configuration]
----
datasources:
  default:
    allow-pool-suspension: true
----

When a checkpoint is taken, the pool is suspended and the connections are closed.  When the checkpoint is restored, the pool is resumed and the connections are re-established.
