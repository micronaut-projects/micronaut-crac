Since v1.2.1 of this library, we also support Redis connections.

When the checkpoint is taken, we destroy `RedisClient`, `RedisCache` and `StatefulRedisConnection` beans that exist in the application.

These will be re-created once the checkpoint is restored, however you will need to add your beans to <<refresh,the refresh scope>> so that these new beans are used.

The resources for each of the above can be disabled via configuration:

[configuration]
----
crac:
    redis:
        enabled: false            # disable all redis support
        client-enabled: false     # disable RedisClient support
        cache-enabled: false      # disable RedisCache support
        connection-enabled: false # disable StatefulRedisConnection support
