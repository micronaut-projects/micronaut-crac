If the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#infoEndpoint[info endpoint] is enabled, then a `crac` section will be automatically added which shows the restore time and uptime since restore, both in milliseconds.

This can be disabled by setting `endpoints.info.crac.enabled` configuration to `false`.
