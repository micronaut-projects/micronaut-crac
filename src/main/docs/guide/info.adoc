If the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#infoEndpoint[info endpoint] is enabled, then a `crac` section will be automatically added which shows the restore time and uptime since restore, both in milliseconds and taken from the https://crac.github.io/openjdk-builds/javadoc/api/jdk.management/jdk/crac/management/CRaCMXBean.html[CRaCMXBean] provided by the CRaC API.

This can be disabled by setting `endpoints.info.crac.enabled` configuration to `false`.
