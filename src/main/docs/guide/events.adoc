To notify external components when the default Resource handlers execute, there are two events; api:crac.events.BeforeCheckpointEvent[] and api:crac.events.AfterRestoreEvent[].
These events contain the `java.time.Instant` that the action completed, the length of time it took to execute the action in nanoseconds, and the Resource that was acted upon.

Please see the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#contextEvents[Micronaut Framework guide] for information on how to listen for these events.
